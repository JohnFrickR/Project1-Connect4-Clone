# Project1-Connect4-Clone

This project is a connect 4 clone, and is my first official game that I have built from scratch. 

The goal of the game is get 4 of your own pieces in a sequence -> diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.

The players can choose who starts and restart the game at any time.
Project Description


I wanted to make a connect 4 clone. It will function the same way as the original game with any 4 connecting dots horizontally, diagonally, vertically winning the player the game. It will be a two player game and it will switch turns and indicate who's turn it is on the screen with a visual indicator saying it is "player... turn" and their color piece showing.

User Stories
Add user stories following the As a [type of user], I want [what the user wants], so that [what it helps accomplish] format. Read more about user stories here.

As a Player I want to be able to choose my piece color so that I can play with what color I want.

As a player I want to be able to choose who starts first or second, because this will change the game fairness.

As a player I want the game to let me know when I've won, so maybe an alert or something that stops the game to let me know I've won would be nice.

As a player I would like the game to track how many times either player has won/lost, a tracker above player names would be nice.

As a player I want to be able to give myself a name in the game, so an input for this would be nice.

MVP Goals

At minimum:

I want the players to be able to input their names

for the game to look formatted well and look clean

for players to be able to place pieces

and for the game to let them know when they have won

Stretch Goals
I want players to be able to be able to choose their own piece colors and to be able to play the game again without having to restart the web page, so they can track who has won and lost.
